# SpectraEngine

SpectraEngine - DirectX Game Engine.

Inspired by **The Cherno**'s game engine series, but built to utilise the DirectX platform on windows.  
There is a potential for support for other libraries for crossplatform support like metal on mac, but not planned for.

**GenerateProjects.bat only supports Visual Studio 2022, modify yourself if required.**  
If using another IDE, let me know or help contribute to not push project files to repository.
